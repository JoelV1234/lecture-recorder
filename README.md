# Background

A Uvic student who is registered with [CAL (Center for accesbility)](https://www.uvic.ca/accessible-learning/index.php), may have an accomodation that allows them to audio record their lectures. Along with other accomodations such as the lecturer must announce what he/she will write on the board, and give a student priority seating in the front row. 

# Problem

An audio recording of the lecture is not capable of capturing the blackboard notes that a professor writes or the powerpoint presenation in the lecture. One option might be to video record the lectures on a smartphone, however this creates three major problems:

- **Permission** → A professor must grant permission for a student to video record their lectures, this applies also to CAL students.
- **Hardware** →A smartphone might not have the camera quality for lecture capture, on most modern smartphones however the camera and microphone is well suitable for video capture of a lecture.
- **Logistics** →Recording a video requires equipment like a tripod, a large hardrive or cloud storage space, and drains your smartphone s battery life so, and therefore may require an external battery bank. If uploading a videos to cloud, a high speed internet connection is also much needed.

# Solution

The solution is to create a lecture recording app that can synchronize audio with slides and can take notes based on a professor ‘s anouncement using AI. This is what the lecture recorder app aims to do.
